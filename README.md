# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework

A comprehensive framework for implementing privacy-preserving federated learning using PyTorch and Streamlit. This project demonstrates secure distributed machine learning while maintaining data privacy through differential privacy techniques.

## Features

- Federated Learning with multiple clients
- Differential Privacy implementation
- Real-time training visualization
- Experiment tracking and storage
- Interactive parameter tuning
- MNIST dataset demonstration

## Structure

- `main.py`: Streamlit web interface and experiment orchestration
- `federated_learning.py`: Core federated learning implementation
- `model.py`: Neural network model architecture
- `differential_privacy.py`: Privacy preservation utilities
- `data_handler.py`: Dataset loading and preprocessing
- `visualization.py`: Training progress visualization
- `database.py`: Experiment tracking and storage

## Usage

1. Configure experiment parameters in the sidebar
2. Start training with the "Start Training" button
3. Monitor training progress and privacy metrics
4. View previous experiment results

## Technical Details

The framework implements federated averaging (FedAvg) with differential privacy guarantees. Each client trains locally, and models are aggregated with noise addition for privacy preservation.


## Iterative Project Development Process
- Reconfigure the existing model you previously designed to fit into the task required now. 

## LIMITATION OF THE CURRENT PROJECT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
Good question. Let me identify some aspects of our implementation that might not fully align with typical federated learning approaches:

1. **Data Distribution Method**:
   - Our implementation randomly distributes data across clients, which assumes centralized access to the full dataset
   - In true federated learning, data is naturally distributed and never leaves the clients
   - We should ideally start with pre-existing distributed data rather than artificially splitting it

2. **Privacy Implementation**:
   - Our differential privacy approach is simplified
   - Real federated learning often uses more sophisticated privacy-preserving techniques like secure aggregation, homomorphic encryption, or formal DP guarantees
   - Our noise addition is basic compared to advanced techniques like PATE or DP-SGD

3. **Communication Simulation**:
   - We're not realistically modeling communication constraints
   - True federated systems deal with bandwidth limitations, dropped connections, and asynchronous updates
   - We assume perfect communication between server and clients

4. **Client Participation**:
   - We assume all clients participate in every round
   - Real federated learning often uses partial client participation where only a subset of clients participate in each round
   - We don't handle client availability issues

5. **Personalization**:
   - We don't support client model personalization
   - Modern federated learning often allows clients to have partially personalized models
   - Techniques like meta-learning or model personalization layers are missing

6. **Client Heterogeneity**:
   - We assume all clients have similar computational capabilities
   - Real-world clients have different hardware, memory constraints, and processing power
   - We don't adapt the training process based on client capabilities

7. **Model Compression**:
   - We send full model parameters between server and clients
   - Production systems often use quantization, sparsification, or sketching to reduce communication
   - We don't implement any bandwidth optimization techniques

8. **System Heterogeneity Handling**:
   - We don't account for system heterogeneity (different OS, hardware, etc.)
   - Real federated systems need to deal with platform differences

9. **Client Selection Strategy**:
   - We don't implement any strategy for selecting which clients participate in each round
   - Advanced systems use various selection strategies based on data quality, client history, etc.

10. **Adversarial Robustness**:
    - No protection against adversarial clients trying to poison the model
    - Real federated systems implement Byzantine-robust aggregation methods

To make our implementation more aligned with true federated learning, we could address these limitations by adding features like partial client participation, better privacy mechanisms, and communication optimization techniques.
